# Overview

A little file that discusses the layout I'd like of this video

## Solutions to sets of linear equations scene

Given a set of linear equations, there are either:
  - infinitely many points,
  - exactly one point, or
  - no points

that satisfy every equation in the set

## 2D slide showing each of the examples

- show each example **AND** how exactly one point is possible
with more equations than dimensions
- show two equations that are same line so have infinitely many
points

## 3D similar to 2D

free ball this one

## Make analogy to linear (in)dependence

The 2D infinite line viewed as a vector can be seen in this way
