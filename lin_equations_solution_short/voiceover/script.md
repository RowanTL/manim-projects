## LinEqSolutions (LinEqSolutions.wav)

When looking at points that solve a linear system of equations, there are three solutions.
Infinitely many points, exactly one point, or no points

## TwoDSystems (split up into multiple files and sections)

### y = x (incorrect_form.wav)

From a linear algebra perspective, y = x is in the incorrect form

### x - y = 0 (correct_form.wav)

Moving the variables to one side and the constants to another is amenable to linear algebra's standards

### Temporarily display coefficients (temp_coeff.wav)

For the sake of demonstration, here are the coefficients of the variables

### Plotting *x - y = 0* with inf solutions (inf_solutions.wav)

Viewing the graph on screen, plotting *x - y = 0*, and placing a dot along the resulting line,
we can see that this system of equations, consisting of a single equation, has infinite solutions
because the dot can move freely to any point on the line.

### Plotting *x + y = 0* with exactly one solution (one_solution.wav)

Plotting *x + y = 0*, we can see that the dot is stuck at the origin, meaning only one solution

### Plotting *2x - y = 0* with one solution (one_sol_3_eqs.wav)

With *2x - y = 0*, there is still only one solution

### Move *2x - y = 0* -> *2x - y = 2* = no solutions (no_solutions.wav)

Changing the right constant to two, we can see the dot disappears, showing the system has
exhausted its possible solutions

### ThreeD Next

In the next video, I'll show this idea in three dimensions
