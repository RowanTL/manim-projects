# FormulaScene

Rodrigues' formula defines how an object rotates in 3D space

# RotationScene

Looking at this 3D graph, the blue vector is to be rotated along the yellow arc into its new position

### Variables start
Looking at the variables, we can slowly piece the rotation equation together

### n_cross matrix
Here is the n cross matrix filled in

### n_cross_sq matrix
Here is the n cross squared matrix filled in

### sin_theta_n_cross
Multiply n_cross by sin(theta)

### one_minus_cos_n_cross
Multiply n cross squared by (1-cos(theta))

### Rotation equation together
Here's the equation once more pieced together into its final matrix

### Multiply by Original vector
Multiply this matrix by the vector v for the final rotated vector u

### Ending words
That's it. Pretty simple
