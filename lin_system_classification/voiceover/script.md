## Consistent & not unique 1 eq (con_not_unique_1_sol.wav)

Looking at this linear system with a single equation, we can see this system
is considered consistent but not unique as there are infinite solutions.

Place @ 0 second mark

## Consistent & not unique 2 eq (con_not_unique_2_sol.wav)

Placing another equation in the system, which is the same as the first
but scaled, we see this system is also consistent and not unique.

Place @ 6 second mark

## consistent & unique (con_unique.wav)

Using the green equation instead, we obtain a system considered
consistent but unique as there is only one solution.

Place at 12 second mark

## inconsistent system (inconsistent.wav)

Transforming the green equation into one considered parallel from the
white, the system is now considered inconsistent.

Place at the 17 second mark
