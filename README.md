# Overview

This repo contains my manim projects.

## Projects

### GP-Overview

*Complete*

These are slides covering genetic programming basics with a fundamental visual view.
Tree-based and PushGP systems are covered. **DEAP** and **PushGP** are covered in the
slides.

I'm writing this with ManimCE and manim_slides.

The presentation took place on September 18th, 2025 6PM CST @ Tech Artista Central West End in Saint Louis, MO

### Rodrigues' Formula Short

*complete*

This is a short uploaded to youtube showing a mathematical formula to rotate an
object in 3D space.

Used ManimCE only

### Specular Reflection Short

*complete*

This is a short uploaded to youtube covering the math behind how light reflects off a perfectly
reflective surface in a single direction. In other words, the surface is perfectly reflective mirror.
Inspired by looking into the different types of [BRDFs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_reflectance_distribution_function).

Used ManimCE only

It was uploaded as a video instead of a short for some reason :(

### 2D Linear System of Equations Short

This is a short visually describing the different possible solutions to a linear system of equations.
I felt like I needed to re-learn some linear algebra, so this is the "back to the basics" so to speak.

### EC Video

*Incomplete*

This was supposed to be a video about Evolutionary Computing and how that works.
I found I didn't have the motivation to do it.
