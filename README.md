### Specular Reflection Short

*almost done*

This is to be a short uploaded to youtube covering the math behind how light reflects off a perfectly
reflective surface in a single direction. In other words, the surface is perfectly reflective mirror.
Inspired by looking into the different types of [BRDFs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_reflectance_distribution_function).

Used ManimCE only

**link soon**

### EC Video

*Incomplete*

This was supposed to be a video about Evolutionary Computing and how that works.
I found I didn't have the motivation to do it.
