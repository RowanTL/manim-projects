# Overview

This repo contains my manim projects.

Follow the instructions here to install [ManimCE](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation/uv.html).
All of these have their own separate [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#getting-started) projects attached to them.

## Projects

### GP-Overview

*Complete*

These are slides covering genetic programming basics with a fundamental visual view.
Tree-based and PushGP systems are covered. **DEAP** and **PushGP** are covered in the
slides.

I'm writing this with ManimCE and manim_slides.

The presentation took place on September 18th, 2025 6PM CST @ Tech Artista Central West End in Saint Louis, MO

### Rodrigues' Formula Short

*Complete*

This is a short uploaded to youtube showing a mathematical formula to rotate an
object in 3D space.

Used ManimCE only

### Specular Reflection Short

*Complete*

This is a short uploaded to youtube covering the math behind how light reflects off a perfectly
reflective surface in a single direction. In other words, the surface is perfectly reflective mirror.
Inspired by looking into the different types of [BRDFs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_reflectance_distribution_function).

Used ManimCE only

It was uploaded as a video instead of a short for some reason :(

### 2D Linear Systems of Equations Short

*Complete*

This is a short visually describing the different possible solutions to a linear system of equations.
I felt like I needed to re-learn some linear algebra, so this is the "back to the basics" so to speak.

### 3D Linear Systems of Equations Short

*Complete*

A 3D version of the 2D short above. There are a few differences in 3 dimensions. Thinking about the differences
between 2D and 3D help grasp how the different solution types come about.

### Linear Systems Solutions Terminology

*Complete*

There is some terminology to classify the solution space of a linear system of equations. Is the system *consistent* or
*inconsistent*? If the system is *consistent*, is the solution *unique*? This short illustrates this how these solutions
come to be.

### Actix Web Presentation

*Complete*

A presentation I'm giving about actix web on December 4th, 2025
6PM CST @ STL Rust. This will basically cover the handbook and go
through a few examples in real time.

Using ManimCE and manim_slides for this.

### Injective/Surjective Intuition

*In Progress*

A little short talking about some intuition I gained while thinking about injective and surjective
functions. Essentially, a linear map from R^3 to R^2 is not injective and linear map from R^2 to R^3
is not surjective.

### EWMAC Short

*Scraped* (In favor of creating an actual video)

A youtube short describing the very basic idea of the EWMAC. I've been playing around with financial data recently
so I thought this would be a fun video to make. Haven't uploaded in a while and feel like it. Seeing that people actually
watch and like my content is rewarding unlike anything else.

### Row Operation Determinant Impact Short

*Scraped* (If I were to come back to a video, it would be this one first)

A youtube short visually showing how row operations on a matrix impact how
a determinant is calculated.

### Set Theory Basics: Union/Intersection

*Scraped*

I'm reading through a topology book and this is material in the first chapter. It was a good refresher on basic logic,
and I would like to make a short covering how it functions.

### Linear Systems Transformations Intuition

*Scraped*

A short describing how a transforming a linear system of equations doesn't actually change anything about
the solution. As humans, we don't immediately see the solution, so we must modify the equations to see
the solution.

### EC Video

*Scraped*

This was supposed to be a video about Evolutionary Computing and how that works.
I found I didn't have the motivation to do it.
