# Overview

A little file that discusses the layout I'd like of this video

## Not Financial Advise Scene

- Make this as obnoxious as possible.
- ***THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVISE***
  - Red text would be good too

## Price Series Scene

- Display some recent price series slowly creeping to the other edge of the screen.
- Need two lookback periods. Probably just go with 2 and 8 for now.
  - Can use polars to calculate this and then place back into numpy array
