A basic manim short describing types of reflections I've studying.

I'll talk about specular and diffuse reflections in this video.

# How to build

Unlike my other projects, `uv` is utilized here more :)

# Notes for later

- I would like to add the equation to calculate reflection somewhere in this short

It would be wise to split these up into smaller scenes later.
It would take a small amount of effort to do this now, but I don't feel like it.
future things todo lol
