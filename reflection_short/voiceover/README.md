# Overview

This file contains a general script I'm going to use for voiceovers

## Fade the axis, surface, and equation in (fade_a_s_e_in.wav)

This graph shows 2 over 5 times sin of x squared + y squared

## Sphere representing the sun with rays (sun_sphere.wav)

The yellow sphere appearing above the surface represents the sun emitting light rays in all directions

## Move everything closer to camera (close_camera.wav)

Zooming into the plane and placing an incident ray originating from
our light source, we can visualize how a perfect specular reflection
works, or in other words, how a perfect mirror reflects light.

# show normals of the surface
