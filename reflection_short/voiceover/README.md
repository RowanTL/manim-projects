# Overview

This file contains a general script I'm going to use for voiceovers

## Fade the axis, surface, and equation in (fade_a_s_e_in.wav)

This graph shows 2 over 5 times sin of x squared + y squared

## Sphere representing the sun with rays (sun_sphere.wav)

The yellow sphere appearing above the surface represents the sun emitting light rays in all directions

## Move everything closer to camera (close_camera.wav)

new:

Zooming into the plane and analyzing the reflection equation, we can see how the light reflected
vector is computed via the surface's unit normal and incident light vectors.

old:

Zooming into the plane, looking at the vector reflection formula above, and placing
an incident ray originating from our light source, we can visualize
how a perfect specular reflection works, or in other words, how a perfect mirror reflects light.

# incident ray and normal arrow explanation (inc_normal.wav)

The yellow arrow represents the incident light ray while the red arrow represents the
surfaces normal

# green arrow explanation (green_arrow.wav)

Following this formula using the information from the incident vector and normal vector,
we can calculate the final reflection vector as shown by the green arrow. Simple as.
