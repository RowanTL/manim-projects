## LinEqSolutions (LinEqSolutions.wav)

To recap from the last video, when looking at points that solve a linear system of equations, there are three solutions.
Infinitely many points, exactly one point, or no points

### Plotting *x + y + z = 0* with inf solutions (inf_sol_1_eq.wav)

Viewing the plane *x + y + z = 0* and placing a line along
it, we can visualize how this line streches across every point
on the plane, creating infinite solutions.

### Plotting *-x - y + z = 0* line stuck (inf_sol_line_stuck.wav)

Plotting *-x - y + z = 0*, we can see the line is stuck at the
intersection of these planes. However, it extends infinitely creating
infinite solutions.

### Plotting *x + 2y + 2z = 0* with one solution (one_sol.wav)

Plotting *x + 2y + 2z = 0* and placing a red dot at the origin, we can
see the system is constrained to a single solution.
