A little file for me to jot down ideas I have for videos.

## Line of Nodes (Orbital Node) video

Found when looking at manim's [begin_ambient_camera_rotation](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/reference/manim.scene.three_d_scene.ThreeDScene.html#manim.scene.three_d_scene.ThreeDScene.begin_ambient_camera_rotation) function.
Seems like this could be useful to understand at some point.
