# Overview

A little file for me to jot down ideas I have for videos.

## Line of Nodes (Orbital Node) video

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_node)

Found when looking at manim's [begin_ambient_camera_rotation](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/reference/manim.scene.three_d_scene.ThreeDScene.html#manim.scene.three_d_scene.ThreeDScene.begin_ambient_camera_rotation) function.
Seems like this could be useful to understand at some point.

## Homegenous Coordinates

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates)

Found out about when reading the computer vision book. Seems like an interesting concept, I just don't know enough about
it to make a video within a day.
